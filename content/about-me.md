## Intro üôè

I am experienced in Data Science, Machine Learning, and exploring technology knowledge. As a fresh graduate majoring in Informatics from the University of Muhammadiyah Malang, I have a strong vision and mission in the world of technology, with a deep interest in Machine Learning, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence, along with a high enthusiasm for data.

## Journey üöÄ

My career in machine learning and AI began at **[Bangkit Academy](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/?tab=machine-learning)**, a program established by stakeholders from major companies in Indonesia such as Tokopedia, Gojek, and Traveloka. As a participant, I learned various concepts related to _Machine Learning, Data Analysis,_ and other related topics, where I leveraged technologies like `Tensorflow`, `Numpy`, `Pandas`, and `Google Cloud` for machine learning development.

After that, I joined **[Sanggar Indonesia](https://sanggar.co.id/)** , as a _Website Developer_, where I utilized technologies such as `WordPress` and `UI/UX`for web application development. During my internship there, I successfully completed several website development projects, including koyulaundry, mjapart, webhoust, and lumpiaboom, which honed my skills in creating functional and visually appealing websites.

My career continued as I joined the **[Project-Based Virtual Intern program](https://homecredit.co.id)**, where I worked as a _Data Scientist_ at **Home Credit Indonesia** in collaboration with **Rakamin Academy**. During this period, I had the opportunity to work on data science projects focused on credit lending, further expanding my knowledge in data analysis and problem-solving.

Not stopping there, I further developed myself by participating in the **[Fresh Graduate Academy (FGA)](https://digitalent.komdigi.go.id/program?akademi=FGA)** program, focusing on _AI Junior Developer_, in collaboration with **Huawei**. In this program, I completed a comprehensive final project and earned the opportunity to qualify for _international certification_, which is only given to participants who meet certain criteria. I am excited to combine my knowledge of _AI_ and _Data Science_ with web development and continue to learn and grow as a professional in the technology field.

## Always Learning üéØ

Constantly seeking to expand my knowledge base, I recently completed a Graduate Degree in Informatics and actively pursue training in emerging technologies.

To stay at the forefront of emerging technologies, data science, and machine learning including business intellgence and data analyst, I've earned several trainings and a certification:
