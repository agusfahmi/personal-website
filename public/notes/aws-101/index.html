Each AWS Region consists of multiple, isolated and physically separated Availability Zones within a geographic area.\nAvailability Zone A group of logical data centers is called an availability zone. They are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, to provide low-latency networking between zones that is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication (same time replication). Typically, 3 availability zone in one region.\nEdge Location Edge locations are connected to the AWS Regions through the AWS network across the globe. It cache copies of customer contents for faster delivery to users at any location.\nPlanning for Failure Storage - File stored in AWS S3, is redundantly copied into every Availability Zone in that Region. Compute - It is a best practice to spread out computing resources across multiple Availability Zones to guarantee high availability. Database - Database can be configured for Multi-AZ deployment. Shared Responsibility Customer are responsible for the security of everything that they create and put IN the AWS cloud. (Security IN the cloud) AWS manages the security OF the cloud, specifically the physical infrastructure that hosts customer resources. (Security OF the cloud) AWS Well-Architected Framework Operational Excellence - run and monitor systems to deliver business value and continually improve supporting processes and procedures. Security - ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies. Reliability - ability to recover from disruptions, dynamically acquire on demand computing resources and mitigate disruptions. Performance Efficiency - ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve. Cost Optimization - ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point. Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) It is a financial metric that is used to estimate and compare direct and indirect costs of a product or a service. It typically includes the actual costs of the procurement, management, maintenance and decommissioning of hardware resources.\nInstances On-Demand instance are ideally used for computing needs that are less than a year. Spot instances are used for computing needs that need to run for low costs and can be interrupted. Lambda instances do not exist. You can use AWS Lambda to process snippets of code, when a Lambda function is triggered. Networking Classless Inter-Domain Routing CIDR, method to define a networkâ€™s IP range contained in it. In below example, the netmask, 24, first 24 (left to right) cannot change. Remaining 8 bits are flexible and can go from 0 to 255 providing 256 IP addresses in the network.\n192.0.2.0/24 Fixed IP address: All 32 bits are fixed. Use case: Set up a firewall rule and give access to a specific host. Internet CIDR block: All 32 bits are flexible. Use case. Setup a firewall rules to allow internet traffic. 192.0.2.0/32 # Fixed IP address 0.0.0.0/0 # Internet CIDR block Subnet Subnet or sub-network, is a network within a network. With this access control over subnets, we can decide which subnets in the networks can communicate with each other. With a subnet, it reduces the bandwidth on the routers and traffic can reach its destination in a shorter amount of time. IP address needs to travel through the router to reach IP in another subnet. Strategic placement of subnets and IPs within the subnet help to reduce network complexities and reduces network loads for more efficient traffic flow.\nPlanning a subnet Note: IP addresses are required by load balancers, switches, routers, servers, workstations, printers, fax machines, mobile. Router and switches require multiple IP addresses.\nPublic Subnet: Allows internet traffic that is routed through an internet gateway to reach the subnet. Private Subnet: Denies traffic to subnet that is routed from the public internet. Access to public internet from private subnet requires a NAT device. Amazon VPC Amazon VPC is a virtual networking environment that gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, which includes resource placement, connectivity, and security. When you launch VPC, choose region, then launch subnets in availability zones.\nVPC IDs, string of random numbers and letters to identify VPC and tags, more identifiable name, are used to associate VPC components to the correct VPC. e.g. vpc-012kkadf232321234 (Development VPC)\nCreating VPC, main route table, network ACL, and security group will be created automatically.\nAWS Direct Connect establish a dedicated, private network connection between your network and one of the Direct Connect locations to reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections. VPC Endpoints provide connections between VPC and supported services. Interface Endpoints AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS Services, and on-premises network without exposing traffic to the public internet. Gateway Endpoints provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for VPC. VPC Peering is network connection between two VPCs that you can use to route traffic between them privately. Restriction: IP address ranges cannot overlap and transitive peering is not supported, must explicitly establish peering connection to be able to communicate. AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub. Route Table Main Route Table directs traffic in VPC, each route specifies a destination, CIDR block or range of address where traffic is supposed to go and a target, the gateway, network interface, or connection through which to send the destination traffic. Each subnet in VPC must be associated with route table and follows many to one rules, many subnets can be associated with same route table.\nSecurity Groups Act as firewalls to allow only the traffic that you authorize and route the traffic to only the parts of your network that you permit. Instance level firewall, filters inbound and outbound traffic that is allowed to instances. Security groups are stateful.\nBy default, there is no inbound traffic rules but thereâ€™s outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic.\nNetwork ACLs Provides an additional level of stateless granular-level security only if required. Network ACLs act at the subnet level and control traffic. Each subnet in VPC must be associated with network ACL. Network ACLs can be associated with multiple subnets. The network administrator would need to update the network ACLs before that return traffic could pass out of the subnet.\nVPC Architecture Setting up AWS account, will automatically provide a default VPC in each AWS Region. Default VPCs have a public subnet with internet access for each Availability Zone in the Region such that EC2 instances can be immediately launched.\nService quota: 5 VPCs per region per account. Can be increased by raising a ticket.\nPublic access to Presentation tier Restricted access to Presentation tier Reserved subnet IP addresses Note: Best practice to create larger subnets (256 IP addresses) instead of small subnets (65 IP addresses)\nReserved IP address Purpose First IP Network address Second IP VPC local router (internal communication) Third IP DNS resolution Fourth IP Future use Last IP Network broadcast address Network Gateway A gateway that determines the traffic that will be given access to network is network gateway.\nInternet Gateway enables communication between VPC and the internet. Virtual Private Gateway enables to connect on-premise site to VPC also referred as site-to-site VPN connection. Elastic IP Elastic IP address replaces the default public IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping the address to another instance in VPC. It operates in Region level, can be used in any VPC in the region where it was created.\nNAT Gateway You can use a NAT gateway so that instances in a private subnet can connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances.\nSecurity Layer of Security Perimeter Layer - security guards, fencing, security feeds, intrusion detection technology, and other security measures. Environmental Layer - environmental considerations from site selection and construction to operations and sustainability. Infrastructure Layer - backup power equipment, HVAC system and fire suppression equipment. Data Layer IAM AWS Identity and Access Management is an AWS service that lets you control user access to services in the AWS Cloud.\nNote: Creating AWS account, you access your account as the AWS account root user, has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account.\nIAM user - entities, represents a specific person or service that uses IAM users to interact with AWS, no permission by default IAM policies - an JSON documents that define specific actions that the entity cna perform on a specific AWS service or resource. IAM group - a group of IAM users that have the same permissions, IAM users in a group inherit the permissions that are granted in IAM policy. It cannot be nested, is unique, arenâ€™t distinguished by case. IAM role - similar to user, a role doesnâ€™t have any credentials associated with it, intended to be used by anyone who needs short term access. Using roles has benefit of specified security credentials not being tied directly to an entity. IAM role trust policy JSON document where principals that you trust to assume the role are defined. IAM Access Analyzer - identify the resources in your organization and accounts that are shared with the external entity, review its findings to determine whether the access is unintended or safe. set or grant, detailed permissions verify who can access what refine by removing overly broad access IAM Credential Types AWS Management Console provided with a username and password. Programmatic access provided with a set of access keys, programmatic calls to AWS using AWS CLI, SDKs, HTTPS. comprised of an access key ID and a secret key. user have two active access keys useful to rotate the userâ€™s access keys or revoke permissions. IAM Identity Center YOu need IAM userâ€™s credentials having necessary permissions to perform create, modify or delete EC2 instance. However, you need instanceâ€™s key pair to perform patch or install software and add or remove file from the instance. The key pairs doesnâ€™t provide accountability for who is using the keys.\nAWS IAM Identity Center (successor to AWS Single Sign-On) help you securely create and connect workforce identities and manage their access centrally across AWS accounts and applications.\nIAM Policies IAM Policies are formal statement of permissions.\nEffect required, specifies statement results is allow or an explicit deny. Explicit Deny takes the precedence. Action describes the specific action or actions that will be allowed or denied. Resource - specifies the object or objects that the statement covers. Specify a resource using Amazon Resource Name (ARN). NotResource - advanced policy element that explicitly matches every resource except those specified. { \"Version\": \"2012-01-01\", \"Statement\": [ { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": [\"DynamoDB:*\", \"s3:*\"], \"Resources\": [ \"arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-number:table/table-name\", \"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name\", \"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*\" ] }, { \"Effect\": \"Deny\", \"Action\": [\"DynamoDB:*\", \"s3:*\"], \"NotResources\": [ \"arn:aws:dynamodb:region:account-number:table/table-name\", \"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name\", \"arn:aws:s3:::bucket-name/*\" ] } ] } Identity and resource based policies Identity based policies are attached to a principal (or identity), such as an IAM user, role, or group.\nAWS managed policies created and managed by AWS. ~1,000 AWS managed policies. Customer managed policies created and managed by customer, precise control. Inline policies are policies that are embedded directly into a single user, group or role. [Not recommended]. Resource based policies are attached to a resource, such as S3 bucket or an AWS Key Management Service. You define the policy on the resource itself and is inline only.\nConflicting policies default implicit deny explicit allow overrides implicit deny explicit deny overrides explicit allow Amazon Cognito Amazon Cognito is fully-managed service that provides authentication and authorization for web and mobile apps. Two main components:\nUser pools user directory that provides sign-up and sign-in options for your app users, federated through a third-party identity provider (IdP). Identity pools enable to create unique identities for your users and federate them with identity providers. temporary and limited privilege AWS credentials to access other AWS services. AWS KMS and Secrets Manager AWS KMS - is data protection services, enables you to create and manage encryption keys, integrates CloudTrail. Customer-managed keys main components: Key administrators, key policies and key users. AWS Secret Manager - centrally manage secrets used to access resources on AWS, on third-party services and on premises, automatically rotate secrets, control access to secrets, and audit and monitor

Access to public internet from private subnet requires a NAT device.</li></ul><h3 id=amazon-vpc>Amazon VPC<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#amazon-vpc>#</a></h3><p>Amazon VPC is a virtual networking environment that gives you full control over your virtual networking environment, which includes resource placement, connectivity, and security. When you launch VPC, choose region, then launch subnets in availability zones.</p><p>VPC IDs, string of random numbers and letters to identify VPC and tags, more identifiable name, are used to associate VPC components to the correct VPC. e.g. <code>vpc-012kkadf232321234 (Development VPC)</code></p><blockquote><p>Creating VPC, main route table, network ACL, and security group will be created automatically.</p></blockquote><ul><li><strong>AWS Direct Connect</strong> establish a dedicated, private network connection between your network and one of the Direct Connect locations to reduce network costs, increase bandwidth throughput, and provide a more consistent network experience than internet-based connections.</li><li><strong>VPC Endpoints</strong> provide connections between VPC and supported services.<ul><li><strong>Interface Endpoints</strong> AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity between VPCs, AWS Services, and on-premises network without exposing traffic to the public internet.</li><li><strong>Gateway Endpoints</strong> provide reliable connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB without requiring an internet gateway or a NAT device for VPC.</li></ul></li><li><strong>VPC Peering</strong> is network connection between two VPCs that you can use to route traffic between them privately. Restriction: IP address ranges cannot overlap and transitive peering is not supported, must explicitly establish peering connection to be able to communicate.</li><li><strong>AWS Transit Gateway</strong> connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub.</li></ul><h4 id=route-table>Route Table<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#route-table>#</a></h4><p>Main Route Table directs traffic in VPC, each route specifies <em>a destination</em>, CIDR block or range of address where traffic is supposed to go and <em>a target</em>, the gateway, network interface, or connection through which to send the destination traffic. Each subnet in VPC must be associated with route table and follows many to one rules, many subnets can be associated with same route table.</p><p><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-91a62 hidden>

Security groups are stateful.</p><p>By default, there is no inbound traffic rules but there&rsquo;s outbound rule that allows all outbound traffic.</p><p><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-10fa4 hidden>

Network ACLs act at the <strong>subnet level</strong> and control traffic. Each subnet in VPC must be associated with network ACL. Network ACLs can be associated with multiple subnets. The network administrator would need to update the network ACLs before that return traffic could pass out of the subnet.</p><p><input type=checkbox id=zoomCheck-7c18b hidden>
